This is a personal project so don't expect it to satisfy your needs. You need a decent experience with JavaScript / TypeScript to make this work out for you.

I've removed "Store" and "Forum" section all over the code and made it serverless (no backend code needed for you to run this).
You can build your own backend and make this work with it - or you can manually enter changelogs in the db/changelogs.json file.

Please don't ask for any help.
